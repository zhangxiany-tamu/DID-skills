Title Doubly Robust Difference-in-Differences Estimators
Version 1.2.2
Description Implements the locally efficient doubly robust difference-in-differences (DiD) estimators for the average treatment effect proposed by Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020) [doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.06.003](doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.06.003). The estimator combines inverse probability weighting and outcome regression estimators (also implemented in the package) to form estimators with more attractive statistical properties. Two different estimation methods can be used to estimate the nuisance functions.

drdid Locally efficient doubly robust DiD estimators for the ATT

## Description

drdid is used to compute the locally efficient doubly robust estimators for the ATT in difference-indifferences (DiD) setups. It can be used with panel or stationary repeated cross section data. Data should be store in "long" format.

## Usage

```
drdid(
    yname,
    tname,
    idname,
    dname,
    xformla = NULL,
    data,
    panel = TRUE,
    estMethod = c("imp", "trad"),
    weightsname = NULL,
    boot = FALSE,
    boot.type = c("weighted", "multiplier"),
```

```
    nboot = 999,
    inffunc = FALSE,
    trim.level = 0.995
)
```


## Arguments

| yname | The name of the outcome variable. |
| :--- | :--- |
| tname | The name of the column containing the time periods. |
| idname | The name of the column containing the unit id name. |
| dname | The name of the column containing the treatment group ( $=1$ if observation is treated in the post-treatment, $=0$ otherwise) |
| xformla | A formula for the covariates to include in the model. It should be of the form $\sim$ X1 + X2 (intercept should not be listed as it is always automatically included). Default is NULL which is equivalent to $x$ formla $=\sim 1$. |
| data | The name of the data.frame that contains the data. |
| panel | Whether or not the data is a panel dataset. The panel dataset should be provided in long format - that is, where each row corresponds to a unit observed at a particular point in time. The default is TRUE. When panel = FALSE, the data is treated as stationary repeated cross sections. |
| estMethod | the method to estimate the nuisance parameters. The default is "imp" which uses weighted least squares to estimate the outcome regressions and inverse probability tilting to the estimate the the propensity score, leading to the improved locally efficient DR DiD estimator proposed by Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020). The other alternative is "trad", which then uses OLS to estimate outcome regressions and maximum likelihood to estimate propensity score. This leads to the "traditional" locally efficient DR DiD estimator proposed by Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020). |
| weightsname | The name of the column containing the sampling weights. If NULL, then every observation has the same weights. The weights are normalized and therefore enforced to have mean 1 across all observations. |
| boot | Logical argument to whether bootstrap should be used for inference. Default is FALSE and analytical standard errors are reported. |
| boot.type | Type of bootstrap to be performed (not relevant if boot = FALSE). Options are "weighted" and "multiplier". If boot = TRUE, default is "weighted". |
| nboot | Number of bootstrap repetitions (not relevant if boot = FALSE). Default is 999. |
| inffunc | Logical argument to whether influence function should be returned. Default is FALSE. |
| trim.level | The level of trimming for the propensity score. Default is 0.995 . |

## Details

When panel data are available (panel = TRUE), the drdid function implements the locally efficient doubly robust difference-in-differences (DiD) estimator for the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) defined in equation (3.1) in Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020). This estimator makes
use of a logistic propensity score model for the probability of being in the treated group, and of a linear regression model for the outcome evolution among the comparison units.
When only stationary repeated cross-section data are available (panel = FALSE), the drdid function implements the locally efficient doubly robust difference-in-differences (DiD) estimator for the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) defined in equation (3.4) in Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020). This estimator makes use of a logistic propensity score model for the probability of being in the treated group, and of (separate) linear regression models for the outcome of both treated and comparison units, in both pre and post-treatment periods.
When one sets estMethod = "imp" (the default), the nuisance parameters (propensity score and outcome regression parameters) are estimated using the methods described in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 of Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020). In short, the propensity score parameters are estimated using the inverse probability tilting estimator proposed by Graham, Pinto and Pinto (2012), and the outcome regression coefficients are estimated using weighted least squares, where the weights depend on the propensity score estimates; see Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020) for details.
When one sets estMethod = "trad", the propensity score parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood, and the outcome regression coefficients are estimated using ordinary least squares.
The main advantage of using estMethod = "imp" is that the resulting estimator is not only locally efficient and doubly robust for the ATT, but it is also doubly robust for inference; see Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020) for details.

## Value

A list containing the following components:

| ATT | The DR DiD point estimate |
| :--- | :--- |
| se | The DR DiD standard error |
| uci | Estimate of the upper bound of a 95\% CI for the ATT |
| lci | Estimate of the lower bound of a 95\% CI for the ATT |
| boots | All Bootstrap draws of the ATT, in case bootstrap was used to conduct inference. Default is NULL |
| att.inf.func | Estimate of the influence function. Default is NULL |
| ps.flag | Convergence Flag for the propensity score estimation (only active if estMethod = "imp".): =0 if trust algorithm converged, =1 if IPT (original) algorithm converged (in case it was used), $=2$ if GLM logit estimator was used (i.e., if both trust and IPT did not converged). |
| call.param | The matched call. |
| argu | Some arguments used in the call (panel, estMethod, boot, boot.type, nboot, type="dr") |

## Details

The drdid_imp_rc1 function implements the doubly robust difference-in-differences (DiD) estimator for the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) defined in equation (3.3) in Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020). This estimator makes use of a logistic propensity score model for the probability of being in the treated group, and of (separate) linear regression models for the outcome among the comparison units in both pre and post-treatment time periods. Importantly, this estimator is not locally efficient for the ATT.
The nuisance parameters (propensity score and outcome regression parameters) are estimated using the methods described in Sections 3.2 of Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020). In short, the propensity score parameters are estimated using the inverse probability tilting estimator proposed by Graham, Pinto and Pinto (2012), and the outcome regression coefficients are estimated using weighted least squares,where the weights depend on the propensity score estimates; see Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020) for details.

The resulting estimator is not only doubly robust for the ATT, but it is also doubly robust for inference. However, we stress that it is not locally efficient; see Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020) for details.

drdid_rc
Locally efficient doubly robust DiD estimator for the ATT, with repeated cross-section data

## Description

drdid_rc is used to compute the locally efficient doubly robust estimators for the ATT in difference-in-differences (DiD) setups with stationary repeated cross-sectional data.

## Usage

```
drdid_rc(
    y,
    post,
    D,
    covariates,
    i.weights = NULL,
    boot = FALSE,
    boot.type = "weighted",
    nboot = NULL,
    inffunc = FALSE,
    trim.level = 0.995
)
```


## Arguments

| post | An $n \times 1$ vector of Post-Treatment dummies (post $=1$ if observation belongs to post-treatment period, and post $=0$ if observation belongs to pre-treatment period.) |
| :--- | :--- |
| D | An $n \times 1$ vector of Group indicators $(=1$ if observation is treated in the posttreatment, $=0$ otherwise). |
| covariates | An $n \times k$ matrix of covariates to be used in the propensity score and regression estimation. Please add a vector of constants if you want to include an intercept in the models. If covariates $=$ NULL, this leads to an unconditional DiD estimator. |
| i.weights | An $n \times 1$ vector of weights to be used. If NULL, then every observation has the same weights. The weights are normalized and therefore enforced to have mean 1 across all observations. |
| boot | Logical argument to whether bootstrap should be used for inference. Default is FALSE. |
| boot.type | Type of bootstrap to be performed (not relevant if boot = FALSE). Options are "weighted" and "multiplier". If boot = TRUE, default is "weighted". |
| nboot | Number of bootstrap repetitions (not relevant if boot = FALSE). Default is 999. |
| inffunc | Logical argument to whether influence function should be returned. Default is FALSE. |
| trim.level | The level of trimming for the propensity score. Default is 0.995 . |

## Details

The drdid_rc function implements the locally efficient doubly robust difference-in-differences (DiD) estimator for the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) defined in equation (3.4) in Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020). This estimator makes use of a logistic propensity score model for the probability of being in the treated group, and of (separate) linear regression models for the outcome of both treated and comparison units, in both pre and post-treatment periods.
The propensity score parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood, and the outcome regression coefficients are estimated using ordinary least squares; see Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020) for details.

## Value

A list containing the following components:

| ATT | The DR DiD point estimate |
| :--- | :--- |
| se | The DR DiD standard error |
| uci | Estimate of the upper bound of a 95\% CI for the ATT |
| lci | Estimate of the lower bound of a 95\% CI for the ATT |
| boots | All Bootstrap draws of the ATT, in case bootstrap was used to conduct inference. Default is NULL |
| att.inf.func | Estimate of the influence function. Default is NULL |
| call.param | The matched call. |
| argu | Some arguments used (explicitly or not) in the call (panel = TRUE, estMethod = "trad", boot, boot.type, nboot, type="dr") |

Doubly robust DiD estimator for the ATT, with repeated cross-section data

## Description

drdid_rc1 is used to compute the doubly robust estimators for the ATT in difference-in-differences (DiD) setups with stationary repeated cross-sectional data. The resulting estimator is not locally efficient; see Section 3.2 of Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020).

## Details

The drdid_rc1 function implements the doubly robust difference-in-differences (DiD) estimator for the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) defined in equation (3.3) in Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020). This estimator makes use of a logistic propensity score model for the probability of being in the treated group, and of (separate) linear regression models for the outcome among the comparison units in both pre and post-treatment time periods. Importantly, this estimator is not locally efficient for the ATT.

The propensity score parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood, and the outcome regression coefficients are estimated using ordinary least squares.
The resulting estimator is not not locally efficient; see Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020) for details.

ipwdid(
    yname,
    tname,
    idname,
    dname,
    xformla = NULL,
    data,
    panel = TRUE,
    normalized = TRUE,
    weightsname = NULL,
    boot = FALSE,
    boot.type = c("weighted", "multiplier"),

| :--- | :--- |
| panel | Whether or not the data is a panel dataset. The panel dataset should be provided in long format - that is, where each row corresponds to a unit observed at a particular point in time. The default is TRUE. When panel = FALSE, the data is treated as stationary repeated cross sections. |
| normalized | Logical argument to whether IPW weights should be normalized to sum up to one. Default is TRUE. |

ordid Outcome regression DiD estimators for the ATT

## Description

ordid computes the outcome regressions estimators for the average treatment effect on the treated in difference-in-differences (DiD) setups. It can be used with panel or repeated cross section data. See Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020) for details.

## Usage

```
ordid(
    yname,
    tname,
    idname,
    dname,
    xformla = NULL,
    data,
    panel = TRUE,
    weightsname = NULL,
    boot = FALSE,
    boot.type = c("weighted", "multiplier"),
    nboot = 999,
    inffunc = FALSE
)
```


## Arguments

yname The name of the outcome variable.
tname The name of the column containing the time periods.
idname The name of the column containing the unit id name.
dname The name of the column containing the treatment group $(=1$ if observation is treated in the post-treatment, $=0$ otherwise)

| xformla | A formula for the covariates to include in the model. It should be of the form $\sim$ X1 + X2. (intercept should not be listed as it is always automatically included). Default is NULL which is equivalent to $x$ formla $=\sim 1$. |
| :--- | :--- |
| data | The name of the data.frame that contains the data. |
| panel | Whether or not the data is a panel dataset. The panel dataset should be provided in long format - that is, where each row corresponds to a unit observed at a particular point in time. The default is TRUE. When panel = FALSE, the data is treated as stationary repeated cross sections. |
| weightsname | The name of the column containing the sampling weights. If NULL, then every observation has the same weights. The weights are normalized and therefore enforced to have mean 1 across all observations. |
| boot | Logical argument to whether bootstrap should be used for inference. Default is FALSE and analytical standard errors are reported. |
| boot.type | Type of bootstrap to be performed (not relevant if boot = FALSE). Options are "weighted" and "multiplier". If boot = TRUE, default is "weighted". |
| nboot | Number of bootstrap repetitions (not relevant if boot = FALSE). Default is 999. |
| inffunc | Logical argument to whether influence function should be returned. Default is FALSE. |

## Details

The ordid function implements outcome regression difference-in-differences (DiD) estimator for the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) defined in equation (2.2) of Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020). The estimator follows the same spirit of the nonparametric estimators proposed by Heckman, Ichimura and Todd (1997), though here the the outcome regression models are assumed to be linear in covariates (parametric).
The nuisance parameters (outcome regression coefficients) are estimated via ordinary least squares.

## Value

A list containing the following components:

| ATT | The OR DiD point estimate |

reg_did_panel Outcome regression DiD estimator for the ATT, with panel data

## Description

reg_did_panel computes the outcome regressions estimators for the average treatment effect on the treated in difference-in-differences (DiD) setups with panel data.

## Usage

```
reg_did_panel(
    y1,
    y0,
    D,
    covariates,
    i.weights = NULL,
    boot = FALSE,
    boot.type = "weighted",
    nboot = NULL,
    inffunc = FALSE
)
```


## Arguments

| y1 | An $n \times 1$ vector of outcomes from the post-treatment period. |
| :--- | :--- |
| yo | An $n \times 1$ vector of outcomes from the pre-treatment period. |
| D | An $n \times 1$ vector of Group indicators $(=1$ if observation is treated in the posttreatment, $=0$ otherwise). Please include a constant to serve as intercept. |
| covariates | An $n \times k$ matrix of covariates to be used in the regression estimation. Please include a column of constants if you want to include an intercept in the regression model. If covariates $=$ NULL, this leads to an unconditional DiD estimator. |
| i.weights | An $n \times 1$ vector of weights to be used. If NULL, then every observation has the same weights. The weights are normalized and therefore enforced to have mean 1 across all observations. |
| boot | Logical argument to whether bootstrap should be used for inference. Default is FALSE. |
| boot.type | Type of bootstrap to be performed (not relevant if boot = FALSE). Options are "weighted" and "multiplier". If boot = TRUE, default is "weighted". |
| nboot | Number of bootstrap repetitions (not relevant if boot = FALSE). Default is 999. |
| inffunc | Logical argument to whether influence function should be returned. Default is FALSE. |

## Details

The reg_did_panel function implements outcome regression difference-in-differences (DiD) estimator for the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) defined in equation (2.2) of Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020) when panel data are available. The estimator follows the same spirit of the nonparametric estimators proposed by Heckman, Ichimura and Todd (1997), though here the the outcome regression models are assumed to be linear in covariates (parametric),
The nuisance parameters (outcome regression coefficients) are estimated via ordinary least squares.

## Value

A list containing the following components:

| ATT | The OR DiD point estimate |
| :--- | :--- |
| se | The OR DiD standard error |
| uci | Estimate of the upper bound of a 95\% CI for the ATT |
| lci | Estimate of the lower bound of a 95\% CI for the ATT |
| boots | All Bootstrap draws of the ATT, in case bootstrap was used to conduct inference. Default is NULL |
| att.inf.func | Estimate of the influence function. Default is NULL |
| call.param | The matched call. |
| argu | Some arguments used (explicitly or not) in the call (panel = TRUE, boot, boot.type, nboot, type="or") |
