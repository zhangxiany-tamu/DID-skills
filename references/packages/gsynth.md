Title Generalized Synthetic Control Method
Version 1.2.1
Date 2021-08-06
Author Yiqing Xu, Licheng Liu
Maintainer Yiqing Xu <yiqingxu@stanford.edu>
Description Provides causal inference with interactive fixed-effect models. It imputes counterfactuals for each treated unit using control group information based on a linear interactive fixed effects model that incorporates unit-specific intercepts interacted with time-varying coefficients. This method generalizes the synthetic control method to the case of multiple treated units and variable treatment periods, and improves efficiency and interpretability. This version supports unbalanced panels and implements the matrix completion method.

## Description

Implements the generalized synthetic control method based on interactive fixed effect models.

## Usage
```
gsynth(formula=NULL, data, Y, D, X = NULL, na.rm = FALSE,
    index, weight = NULL, force = "unit", cl = NULL, r = 0,
    lambda = NULL, nlambda = 10, CV = TRUE, criterion = "mspe",
    k = 5, EM = FALSE, estimator = "ife",
    se = FALSE, nboots = 200,
    inference = "nonparametric", cov.ar = 1, parallel = TRUE,
    cores = NULL, tol = 0.001, seed = NULL, min.T0 = 5,
    alpha = 0.05, normalize = FALSE)
```


## Arguments
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline formula & an object of class "formula": a symbolic description of the model to be fitted. \\
\hline data & a data frame (must be with a dichotomous treatment but balanced is not required). \\
\hline Y & outcome. \\
\hline D & treatment. \\
\hline X & time-varying covariates. \\
\hline na.rm & a logical flag indicating whether to list-wise delete missing data. The algorithm will report an error if missing data exist. \\
\hline index & a two-element string vector specifying the unit (group) and time indicators. Must be of length 2 . \\
\hline weight & a string specifying the weighting variable(if any) to estimate the weighted average treatment effect. Default is weight = NULL. \\
\hline force & a string indicating whether unit or time fixed effects will be imposed. Must be one of the following, "none", "unit", "time", or "two-way". The default is "unit". \\
\hline cl & a string indicator the cluster variable. The default value is NULL. If cl = NULL, bootstrap will be blocked at unit level (only for non-parametric bootstrap). \\
\hline r & an integer specifying the number of factors. If CV $=$ TRUE, the cross validation procedure will select the optimal number of factors from $r$ to 5 . \\
\hline lambda & a single or sequence of positive numbers specifying the hyper-parameter sequence for matrix completion method. If lambda is a sequence and $\mathrm{CV}=1$, cross-validation will be performed. \\
\hline nlambda & an integer specifying the length of hyper-parameter sequence for matrix completion method. Default is nlambda $=10$. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline CV & a logical flag indicating whether cross-validation will be performed to select the optimal number of factors or hyper-parameter in matrix completion algorithm. If $r$ is not specified, the procedure will search through $r=0$ to 5 . \\
\hline criterion & a string specifying the criteria used for determining the number of factors. Choose from c ("mspe", "pc"). "mspe" stands for the mean squared prediction error obtained through the loocv procedure, and "pc" stands for a kind of information criterion. If criterion = "pc", the number of factors that minimize "pc" will be selected. Default is criterion = "mspe". \\
\hline k & a positive integer specifying cross-validation times for matrix completion algorithm. Default is $\mathrm{k}=5$. \\
\hline EM & a logical flag indicating whether an Expectation Maximization algorithm will be used (Gobillon and Magnac 2016). \\
\hline estimator & a string that controls the estimation method, either "ife" (interactive fixed effects) or "mc" (the matrix completion method). \\
\hline se & a logical flag indicating whether uncertainty estimates will be produced. \\
\hline nboots & an integer specifying the number of bootstrap runs. Ignored if se = FALSE. \\
\hline inference & a string specifying which type of inferential method will be used, either "parametric" or "nonparametric". "parametric" is recommended when the number of treated units is small. parametric bootstrap is not valid for matrix completion method. Ignored if estimator $=$ "mc". \\
\hline cov.ar & an integer specifying order of the auto regression process that the residuals follow. Used for parametric bootstrap procedure when data is in the form of unbalanced panel. The default value is 1 . \\
\hline parallel & a logical flag indicating whether parallel computing will be used in bootstrapping and/or cross-validation. Ignored if se = FALSE. \\
\hline cores & an integer indicating the number of cores to be used in parallel computing. If not specified, the algorithm will use the maximum number of logical cores of your computer (warning: this could prevent you from multi-tasking on your computer). \\
\hline tol & a positive number indicating the tolerance level. \\
\hline seed & an integer that sets the seed in random number generation. Ignored if se = FALSE and $r$ is specified. \\
\hline min.T0 & an integer specifying the minimum value of pre-treatment periods. Treated units with pre-treatment periods less than that will be removed automatically. This item is important for unbalanced panels. If users want to perform cross validation procedure to select the optimal number of factors from (r.min, r.max), they should set min. T0 larger than ( $r . \max +1$ ) if no individual fixed effects or ( $r . \max +2$ ) otherwise. If there are too few pre-treatment periods among all treated units, a smaller value of $r$.max is recommended. \\
\hline alpha & a positive number in the range of 0 and 1 specifying significant levels for uncertainty estimates. The default value is alpha $=0.05$. \\
\hline normalize & a logic flag indicating whether to scale outcome and covariates. Useful for accelerating computing speed when magnitude of data is large. The default is normalize=FALSE. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

## Details
gsynth implements the generalized synthetic control method. It imputes counterfactuals for each treated unit using control group information based on a linear interactive fixed effects model that incorporates unit-specific intercepts interacted with time-varying coefficients. It generalizes the synthetic control method to the case of multiple treated units and variable treatment periods, and improves efficiency and interpretability. It allows the treatment to be correlated with unobserved unit and time heterogeneities under reasonable modeling assumptions. With a built-in cross-validation procedure, it avoids specification searches and thus is easy to implement. Data must be with a dichotomous treatment.
