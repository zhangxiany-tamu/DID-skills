Title Treatment Effects with Multiple Periods and Groups
Version 2.1.2
URL https://bcallaway11.github.io/did/, https://github.com/bcallaway11/did/
Description The standard Difference-in-Differences (DID) setup involves two periods and two groups -- a treated group and untreated group. Many applications of DID methods involve more than two periods and have individuals that are treated at different points in time. This package contains tools for computing average treatment effect parameters in Difference in Differences setups with more than two periods and with variation in treatment timing using the methods developed in Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021) [doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.12.001](doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.12.001). The main parameters are group-time average treatment effects which are the average treatment effect for a particular group at a a particular time. These can be aggregated into a fewer number of treatment effect parameters, and the package deals with the cases where there is selective treatment timing, dynamic treatment effects, calendar time effects, or combinations of these. There are also functions for testing the Difference in Differences assumption, and plotting group-time average treatment effects.

aggte Aggregate Group-Time Average Treatment Effects

## Description

A function to take group-time average treatment effects and aggregate them into a smaller number of parameters. There are several possible aggregations including "simple", "dynamic", "group", and "calendar."

## Usage

```
aggte(
    MP,
    type = "group",
    balance_e = NULL,
    min_e = -Inf,
    max_e = Inf,
    na.rm = FALSE,
    bstrap = NULL,
    biters = NULL,
    cband = NULL,
    alp = NULL,
    clustervars = NULL
)
```


## Arguments

| MP | an MP object (i.e., the results of the att_gt() method) |
| :--- | :--- |
| type | Which type of aggregated treatment effect parameter to compute. One option is "simple" (this just computes a weighted average of all group-time average treatment effects with weights proportional to group size). Other options are "dynamic" (this computes average effects across different lengths of exposure to the treatment and is similar to an "event study"; here the overall effect averages the effect of the treatment across all positive lengths of exposure); "group" (this is the default option and computes average treatment effects across different groups; here the overall effect averages the effect across different groups); and "calendar" (this computes average treatment effects across different time periods; here the overall effect averages the effect across each time period). |
| balance_e | If set (and if one computes dynamic effects), it balances the sample with respect to event time. For example, if balance.e=2, aggte will drop groups that are not exposed to treatment for at least three periods. (the initial period when $\mathrm{e}=0$ as well as the next two periods when $\mathrm{e}=1$ and the $\mathrm{e}=2$ ). This ensures that the composition of groups does not change when event time changes. |
| min_e | For event studies, this is the smallest event time to compute dynamic effects for. By default, min_e = -Inf so that effects at all lengths of exposure are computed. |
| max_e | For event studies, this is the largest event time to compute dynamic effects for. By default, max_e = Inf so that effects at all lengths of exposure are computed. |
| na.rm | Logical value if we are to remove missing Values from analyses. Defaults is FALSE. |
| bstrap | Boolean for whether or not to compute standard errors using the multiplier bootstrap. If standard errors are clustered, then one must set bstrap=TRUE. Default is value set in the MP object. If bstrap is FALSE, then analytical standard errors are reported. |
| biters | The number of bootstrap iterations to use. The default is the value set in the MP object, and this is only applicable if bstrap=TRUE. |


| cband | Boolean for whether or not to compute a uniform confidence band that covers all of the group-time average treatment effects with fixed probability 1-alp. In order to compute uniform confidence bands, bstrap must also be set to TRUE. The default is the value set in the MP object |
| :--- | :--- |
| alp | the significance level, default is value set in the MP object. |
| clustervars | A vector of variables to cluster on. At most, there can be two variables (otherwise will throw an error) and one of these must be the same as idname which allows for clustering at the individual level. Default is the variables set in the MP object |

## Value

An AGGTEobj object that holds the results from the aggregation

## Examples

Initial ATT(g,t) estimates from att_gt()

```
data(mpdta)
out <- att_gt(yname="lemp",
    tname="year",
    idname="countyreal",
    gname="first.treat",
    xformla=NULL,
    data=mpdta)
```

AGGTEobj
AGGTEobj

## Description

)
```


## Arguments

| overall.att | The estimated overall ATT |
| :--- | :--- |
| overall.se | Standard error for overall ATT |
| type | Which type of aggregated treatment effect parameter to compute. One option is "simple" (this just computes a weighted average of all group-time average treatment effects with weights proportional to group size). Other options are "dynamic" (this computes average effects across different lengths of exposure to the treatment and is similar to an "event study"; here the overall effect averages the effect of the treatment across all positive lengths of exposure); "group" (this is the default option and computes average treatment effects across different groups; here the overall effect averages the effect across different groups); and "calendar" (this computes average treatment effects across different time periods; here the overall effect averages the effect across each time period). |

| balance_e | If set (and if one computes dynamic effects), it balances the sample with respect to event time. For example, if balance.e=2, aggte will drop groups that are not exposed to treatment for at least three periods. (the initial period when $\mathrm{e}=0$ as well as the next two periods when $\mathrm{e}=1$ and the $\mathrm{e}=2$ ).

## Value

an AGGTEobj

```
att_gt Group-Time Average Treatment Effects
```


## Description

att_gt computes average treatment effects in DID setups where there are more than two periods of data and allowing for treatment to occur at different points in time and allowing for treatment effect heterogeneity and dynamics. See Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021) for a detailed description.

## Usage

```
att_gt(
    yname,
    tname,
    idname = NULL,
    gname,
    xformla = NULL,
    data,
    panel = TRUE,
    allow_unbalanced_panel = FALSE,
    control_group = c("nevertreated", "notyettreated"),
    anticipation = 0,
    weightsname = NULL,
    alp = 0.05,
    bstrap = TRUE,
    cband = TRUE,
    biters = 1000,
    clustervars = NULL,
    est_method = "dr",
    base_period = "varying",
    print_details = FALSE,
    pl = FALSE,
    cores = 1
)
```


## Arguments

| yname | The name of the outcome variable |
| :--- | :--- |
| tname | The name of the column containing the time periods |
| idname | The individual (cross-sectional unit) id name |
| gname | The name of the variable in data that contains the first period when a particular observation is treated. This should be a positive number for all observations in treated groups. It defines which "group" a unit belongs to. It should be 0 for units in the untreated group. |


| xformla | A formula for the covariates to include in the model. It should be of the form $\sim \mathrm{X} 1+\mathrm{X} 2$. Default is NULL which is equivalent to $\mathrm{xformla}=\sim 1$. This is used to create a matrix of covariates which is then passed to the $2 \times 2$ DID estimator chosen in est_method. |
| :--- | :--- |
| data | The name of the data.frame that contains the data |
| panel | Whether or not the data is a panel dataset. The panel dataset should be provided in long format - that is, where each row corresponds to a unit observed at a particular point in time. The default is TRUE. When is using a panel dataset, the variable idname must be set. When panel=FALSE, the data is treated as repeated cross sections. |
| allow_unbalanced_panel |  |
|  | Whether or not function should "balance" the panel with respect to time and id. The default values if FALSE which means that att_gt() will drop all units where data is not observed in all periods. The advantage of this is that the computations are faster (sometimes substantially). |
| control_group | Which units to use the control group. The default is "nevertreated" which sets the control group to be the group of units that never participate in the treatment. This group does not change across groups or time periods. The other option is to set group="notyettreated". In this case, the control group is set to the group of units that have not yet participated in the treatment in that time period. This includes all never treated units, but it includes additional units that eventually participate in the treatment, but have not participated yet. |
| anticipation | The number of time periods before participating in the treatment where units can anticipate participating in the treatment and therefore it can affect their untreated potential outcomes |
| weightsname | The name of the column containing the sampling weights. If not set, all observations have same weight. |
| alp | the significance level, default is 0.05 |
| bstrap | Boolean for whether or not to compute standard errors using the multiplier bootstrap. If standard errors are clustered, then one must set bstrap=TRUE. Default is TRUE (in addition, cband is also by default TRUE indicating that uniform confidence bands will be returned. If bstrap is FALSE, then analytical standard errors are reported. |
| cband | Boolean for whether or not to compute a uniform confidence band that covers all of the group-time average treatment effects with fixed probability 1-alp. In order to compute uniform confidence bands, bstrap must also be set to TRUE. The default is TRUE. |
| biters | The number of bootstrap iterations to use. The default is 1000 , and this is only applicable if bstrap=TRUE. |
| clustervars | A vector of variables names to cluster on. At most, there can be two variables (otherwise will throw an error) and one of these must be the same as idname which allows for clustering at the individual level. By default, we cluster at individual level (when bstrap=TRUE). |
| est_method | the method to compute group-time average treatment effects. The default is "dr" which uses the doubly robust approach in the DRDID package. Other built-in |

methods include "ipw" for inverse probability weighting and "reg" for first step regression estimators. The user can also pass their own function for estimating group time average treatment effects. This should be a function $\mathrm{f}(\mathrm{Y} 1, \mathrm{Y} 0$, treat, covariates) where Y 1 is an $\mathrm{n} \times 1$ vector of outcomes in the post-treatment outcomes, Y 0 is an $n \times 1$ vector of pre-treatment outcomes, treat is a vector indicating whether or not an individual participates in the treatment, and covariates is an $n \times k$ matrix of covariates. The function should return a list that includes ATT (an estimated average treatment effect), and inf. func (an $\mathrm{n} \times 1$ influence function). The function can return other things as well, but these are the only two that are required. est_method is only used if covariates are included.
base_period Whether to use a "varying" base period or a "universal" base period. Either choice results in the same post-treatment estimates of ATT(g,t)'s. In pre-treatment periods, using a varying base period amounts to computing a pseudo-ATT in each treatment period by comparing the change in outcomes for a particular group relative to its comparison group in the pre-treatment periods (i.e., in pretreatment periods this setting computes changes from period $\mathrm{t}-1$ to period t , but repeatedly changes the value of t )
A universal base period fixes the base period to always be (g-anticipation-1). This does not compute pseudo-ATT(g,t)'s in pre-treatment periods, but rather reports average changes in outcomes from period $t$ to ( $g$-anticipation-1) for a particular group relative to its comparison group. This is analogous to what is often reported in event study regressions.
Using a varying base period results in an estimate of ATT(g,t) being reported in the period immediately before treatment. Using a universal base period normalizes the estimate in the period right before treatment (or earlier when the user allows for anticipation) to be equal to 0 , but one extra estimate in an earlier period.
print_details Whether or not to show details/progress of computations. Default is FALSE.
pl Whether or not to use parallel processing
cores The number of cores to use for parallel processing

)
```


## Arguments

| yname | The name of the outcome variable |
| :--- | :--- |
| tname | The name of the column containing the time periods |
| idname | The individual (cross-sectional unit) id name |
| gname | The name of the variable in data that contains the first period when a particular observation is treated. This should be a positive number for all observations in treated groups. It defines which "group" a unit belongs to. It should be 0 for units in the untreated group. |
| xformla | A formula for the covariates to include in the model. It should be of the form $\sim \mathrm{X} 1+\mathrm{X} 2$. Default is NULL which is equivalent to $\mathrm{xformla}=\sim 1$. This is used to create a matrix of covariates which is then passed to the $2 \times 2$ DID estimator chosen in est_method. |


| data | The name of the data.frame that contains the data |
| :--- | :--- |
| panel | Whether or not the data is a panel dataset. The panel dataset should be provided in long format - that is, where each row corresponds to a unit observed at a particular point in time. The default is TRUE. When is using a panel dataset, the variable idname must be set. When panel=FALSE, the data is treated as repeated cross sections. |
|  | allow_unbalanced_panel <br> Whether or not function should "balance" the panel with respect to time and id. The default values if FALSE which means that att_gt() will drop all units where data is not observed in all periods. The advantage of this is that the computations are faster (sometimes substantially). |
| control_group | Which units to use the control group. The default is "nevertreated" which sets the control group to be the group of units that never participate in the treatment. This group does not change across groups or time periods. The other option is to set group="notyettreated". In this case, the control group is set to the group of units that have not yet participated in the treatment in that time period. This includes all never treated units, but it includes additional units that eventually participate in the treatment, but have not participated yet. |
| weightsname | The name of the column containing the sampling weights. If not set, all observations have same weight. |
| alp | the significance level, default is 0.05 |
| bstrap | Boolean for whether or not to compute standard errors using the multiplier bootstrap. If standard errors are clustered, then one must set bstrap=TRUE. Default is TRUE (in addition, cband is also by default TRUE indicating that uniform confidence bands will be returned. If bstrap is FALSE, then analytical standard errors are reported. |
| cband | Boolean for whether or not to compute a uniform confidence band that covers all of the group-time average treatment effects with fixed probability 1-alp. In order to compute uniform confidence bands, bstrap must also be set to TRUE. The default is TRUE. |
| biters | The number of bootstrap iterations to use. The default is 1000 , and this is only applicable if bstrap=TRUE. |
| clustervars | A vector of variables names to cluster on. At most, there can be two variables (otherwise will throw an error) and one of these must be the same as idname which allows for clustering at the individual level. By default, we cluster at individual level (when bstrap=TRUE). |
| est_method | the method to compute group-time average treatment effects. The default is "dr" which uses the doubly robust approach in the DRDID package. Other built-in methods include "ipw" for inverse probability weighting and "reg" for first step regression estimators. The user can also pass their own function for estimating group time average treatment effects. This should be a function $\mathrm{f}(\mathrm{Y} 1, \mathrm{Y} 0$, treat, covariates) where Y 1 is an $\mathrm{n} \times 1$ vector of outcomes in the post-treatment outcomes, Y 0 is an $\mathrm{n} \times 1$ vector of pre-treatment outcomes, treat is a vector indicating whether or not an individual participates in the treatment, and covariates is an $\mathrm{n} \times \mathrm{k}$ matrix of covariates. The function should return a list that includes ATT (an estimated average treatment effect), and inf. func (an $\mathrm{n} \times 1$ influence function). |

The function can return other things as well, but these are the only two that are required. est_method is only used if covariates are included.
print_details Whether or not to show details/progress of computations. Default is FALSE.
pl Whether or not to use parallel processing
cores The number of cores to use for parallel processing

## Value

an MP. TEST object

## Arguments

| yname | The name of the outcome variable |
| :--- | :--- |
| tname | The name of the column containing the time periods |
| idname | The individual (cross-sectional unit) id name |
| gname | The name of the variable in data that contains the first period when a particular <br> observation is treated. This should be a positive number for all observations in |


|  | treated groups. It defines which "group" a unit belongs to. It should be 0 for units in the untreated group. |
| :--- | :--- |
| xformla | A formula for the covariates to include in the model. It should be of the form $\sim \mathrm{X} 1+\mathrm{X} 2$. Default is NULL which is equivalent to $\mathrm{xformla}=\sim 1$. This is used to create a matrix of covariates which is then passed to the $2 \times 2$ DID estimator chosen in est_method. |
| data | The name of the data.frame that contains the data |
| control_group | Which units to use the control group. The default is "nevertreated" which sets the control group to be the group of units that never participate in the treatment. This group does not change across groups or time periods. The other option is to set group="notyettreated". In this case, the control group is set to the group of units that have not yet participated in the treatment in that time period. This includes all never treated units, but it includes additional units that eventually participate in the treatment, but have not participated yet. |
| anticipation | The number of time periods before participating in the treatment where units can anticipate participating in the treatment and therefore it can affect their untreated potential outcomes |
| weightsname | The name of the column containing the sampling weights. If not set, all observations have same weight. |
| alp | the significance level, default is 0.05 |
| bstrap | Boolean for whether or not to compute standard errors using the multiplier bootstrap. If standard errors are clustered, then one must set bstrap=TRUE. Default is TRUE (in addition, cband is also by default TRUE indicating that uniform confidence bands will be returned. If bstrap is FALSE, then analytical standard errors are reported. |
| biters | The number of bootstrap iterations to use. The default is 1000 , and this is only applicable if bstrap=TRUE. |
| clustervars | A vector of variables names to cluster on. At most, there can be two variables (otherwise will throw an error) and one of these must be the same as idname which allows for clustering at the individual level. By default, we cluster at individual level (when bstrap=TRUE). |
| cband | Boolean for whether or not to compute a uniform confidence band that covers all of the group-time average treatment effects with fixed probability $1-\mathrm{alp}$. In order to compute uniform confidence bands, bstrap must also be set to TRUE. The default is TRUE. |
| print_details | Whether or not to show details/progress of computations. Default is FALSE. |
| pl | Whether or not to use parallel processing |
| cores | The number of cores to use for parallel processing |
| est_method | the method to compute group-time average treatment effects. The default is "dr" which uses the doubly robust approach in the DRDID package. Other built-in methods include "ipw" for inverse probability weighting and "reg" for first step regression estimators. The user can also pass their own function for estimating group time average treatment effects. This should be a function $\mathrm{f}(\mathrm{Y} 1, \mathrm{Y} 0$, treat, covariates) where Y 1 is an $\mathrm{n} \times 1$ vector of outcomes in the post-treatment outcomes, Y 0 is |

an $\mathrm{n} \times 1$ vector of pre-treatment outcomes, treat is a vector indicating whether or not an individual participates in the treatment, and covariates is an $n \times k$ matrix of covariates. The function should return a list that includes ATT (an estimated average treatment effect), and inf. func (an $\mathrm{n} \times 1$ influence function). The function can return other things as well, but these are the only two that are required. est_method is only used if covariates are included.
base_period Whether to use a "varying" base period or a "universal" base period. Either choice results in the same post-treatment estimates of ATT(g,t)'s. In pre-treatment periods, using a varying base period amounts to computing a pseudo-ATT in each treatment period by comparing the change in outcomes for a particular group relative to its comparison group in the pre-treatment periods (i.e., in pretreatment periods this setting computes changes from period $\mathrm{t}-1$ to period t , but repeatedly changes the value of t )
A universal base period fixes the base period to always be (g-anticipation-1). This does not compute pseudo-ATT(g,t)'s in pre-treatment periods, but rather reports average changes in outcomes from period $t$ to ( $g$-anticipation-1) for a particular group relative to its comparison group. This is analogous to what is often reported in event study regressions.
Using a varying base period results in an estimate of ATT(g,t) being reported in the period immediately before treatment. Using a universal base period normalizes the estimate in the period right before treatment (or earlier when the user allows for anticipation) to be equal to 0 , but one extra estimate in an earlier period.
panel Whether or not the data is a panel dataset. The panel dataset should be provided in long format - that is, where each row corresponds to a unit observed at a particular point in time. The default is TRUE. When is using a panel dataset, the variable idname must be set. When panel=FALSE, the data is treated as repeated cross sections.
true_repeated_cross_sections
Whether or not the data really is repeated cross sections. (We include this because unbalanced panel code runs through the repeated cross sections code)
$n \quad$ The number of observations. This is equal to the number of units (which may be different from the number of rows in a panel dataset).
nG The number of groups
nT The number of time periods
tlist a vector containing each time period
glist a vector containing each group
call Function call to att_gt

The function can return other things as well, but these are the only two that are required. est_method is only used if covariates are included.
base_period Whether to use a "varying" base period or a "universal" base period. Either choice results in the same post-treatment estimates of ATT(g,t)'s. In pre-treatment periods, using a varying base period amounts to computing a pseudo-ATT in each treatment period by comparing the change in outcomes for a particular group relative to its comparison group in the pre-treatment periods (i.e., in pretreatment periods this setting computes changes from period $\mathrm{t}-1$ to period t , but repeatedly changes the value of t )
A universal base period fixes the base period to always be (g-anticipation-1). This does not compute pseudo-ATT(g,t)'s in pre-treatment periods, but rather reports average changes in outcomes from period $t$ to ( $g$-anticipation-1) for a particular group relative to its comparison group. This is analogous to what is often reported in event study regressions.
Using a varying base period results in an estimate of ATT(g,t) being reported in the period immediately before treatment. Using a universal base period normalizes the estimate in the period right before treatment (or earlier when the user allows for anticipation) to be equal to 0 , but one extra estimate in an earlier period.
print_details Whether or not to show details/progress of computations. Default is FALSE.
pl Whether or not to use parallel processing
cores The number of cores to use for parallel processing
call Function call to att_gt

```


## Arguments

```
attgt.list list of results from compute.att_gt()
```

```

```
reset.sim
reset.sim
```


## Description

a function to create a "reasonable" set of parameters to create simulated panel data that obeys a parallel trends assumption. In particular, it provides parameters where the the effect of participating in the treatment is equal to one in all post-treatment time periods.

After calling this function, the user can change particular values of the parameters in order to generate dynamics, heterogeneous effects across groups, etc.

## Usage

reset.sim(time.periods $=4, \mathrm{n}=5000, \mathrm{ipw}=$ TRUE, reg $=$ TRUE)

## Arguments

time.periods The number of time periods to include
$n \quad$ The total number of observations
ipw If TRUE, sets parameters so that DGP is compatible with recovering ATT( $\mathrm{g}, \mathrm{t}$ )'s using IPW (i.e., where logit that just includes a linear term in X works). If FALSE, sets parameters that will be incompatible with IPW. Either way, these parameters can be specified by the user if so desired.
reg If TRUE, sets parameters so that DGP is compatible with recovering ATT(g,t)'s using regressions on untreated untreated potential outcomes. If FALSE, sets parameters that will be incompatible with using regressions (i.e., regressions that include only linear term in X). Either way, these parameters can be specified by the user if so desired.

## Value

list of simulation parameters
$\operatorname{sim} \operatorname{sim} \operatorname{sim}$

## Description

An internal function that builds simulated data, computes ATT(g,t)'s and some aggregations. It is useful for testing the inference procedures in the did function.

## Usage

```
sim(
    sp_list,
    ret = NULL,
    bstrap = TRUE,
    cband = TRUE,
    control_group = "nevertreated",
    xformla = ~X,
    est_method = "dr",
    clustervars = NULL,
    panel = TRUE
)
```


## Arguments

| sp_list | A list of simulation parameters. See reset. sim to generate some default values for parameters |
| :--- | :--- |
| ret | which type of results to return. The options are Wpval (returns 1 if the p-value from a Wald test that all pre-treatment ATT(g,t)'s are equal is less than .05 ), cband (returns 1 if a uniform confidence band covers 0 for groups and times), simple (returns 1 if, using the simple treatment effect aggregation results in rejecting that this aggregated treatment effect parameter is equal to 0 ), dynamic (returns 1 if the uniform confidence band from the dynamic treatment effect aggregation covers 0 in all pre- and post-treatment periods). The default value is NULL, and in this case the function will just return the results from the call to att_gt. |
| bstrap | whether or not to use the bootstrap to conduct inference (default is TRUE) |
| cband | whether or not to compute uniform confidence bands in the call to att_gt (the default is TRUE) |
| control_group | Whether to use the "nevertreated" comparison group (the default) or the "notyettreated" as the comparison group |
| xformla | Formula for covariates in att_gt (default is $\sim \mathrm{X}$ ) |
| est_method | Which estimation method to use in att_gt (default is "dr") |
| clustervars | Any additional variables which should be clustered on |
| panel | whether to simulate panel data (the default) or otherwise repeated cross sections data |

## Value

When ret=NULL, returns the results of the call to att_gt, otherwise returns 1 if the specified test rejects or 0 if not.

```
trimmer
trimmer
```


## Description

A utility function to find observations that appear to violate support conditions. This function is not called anywhere in the code, but it is just useful for debugging some common issues that users run into.

## Usage

```
trimmer(
    g,
    tname,
    idname,
    gname,
    xformla,
    data,
    control_group = "notyettreated",
    threshold = 0.999
)
```


## Arguments

| g | is a particular group (below I pass in 2009) |
| :--- | :--- |
| tname | The name of the column containing the time periods |
| idname | The individual (cross-sectional unit) id name |
| gname | The name of the variable in data that contains the first period when a particular observation is treated. This should be a positive number for all observations in treated groups. It defines which "group" a unit belongs to. It should be 0 for units in the untreated group. |
| xformla | A formula for the covariates to include in the model. It should be of the form $\sim \mathrm{X} 1+\mathrm{X} 2$. Default is NULL which is equivalent to $\mathrm{xformla}=\sim 1$. This is used to create a matrix of covariates which is then passed to the $2 \times 2$ DID estimator chosen in est_method. |
| data | The name of the data.frame that contains the data |
| control_group | Which units to use the control group. The default is "nevertreated" which sets the control group to be the group of units that never participate in the treatment. This group does not change across groups or time periods. The other option is to set group="notyettreated". In this case, the control group is set to the group of units that have not yet participated in the treatment in that time period. This includes all never treated units, but it includes additional units that eventually participate in the treatment, but have not participated yet. |
| threshold | the cutoff for which observations are flagged as likely violators of the support condition. |

Value
list of ids of observations that likely violate support conditions
